## How to get started
### Compiled version

Download a compiled version of Dxm for required platform from a [releases  page](https://github.com/delphix/dxm-toolkit/releases).
Dxm keep a configuration using SQLLite database and it's creating a configuration file when a first engine is added.
When Dxm is started it will execute an action against Masking engine specified in option or against engine configured as default one.

Compiled version is distributed as single command on Linux and OSX and a zipped folder on Windows platform.
Single command distribution on Windows is limited by PyInstaller issue which require to disable some security features on Windows 10.
To start a DXM on the Linux or OSX, please run dxmc command from place where it was downloaded. On Windows please run dxmc.exe from unzipped folder.

Configure a masking engine using the following steps:

* add engine
```
dxmc engine add --engine testeng --ip testeng.foo.com --username delphix_admin --default Y
Password:
Repeat for confirmation:
Engine added to configuration
```

* list all engines from configuration
```
dxmc engine list

Engine name                     IP                              username                        protocol  port   default

```
